Arbnb Hunter

Modified Egor Homakov's Arbnb Hunter to find and sort top rated Arbnb apartments https://medium.com/@homakov/airbnb-hunter-find-perfect-apartments-ee418c06f60e

1. Go to airbnb and search for a specific location, date, beds, and other filters you would set normally. Be as specific as possible, because narrowing down search at this point leaves less work for our parser.
2. Move the map a little, ensure the URL now has ne_lng
3. Open console and copy paste the script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Untit1ed/bnbSorting/main/hunterParse.js
